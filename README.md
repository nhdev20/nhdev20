**About Me**

My brain speaks the language of analysis, enjoys travelling through conceptual landscapes, and processes from the bottom up (with an eye on the larger picture). Ideas, therefore, are what help make sense of the different chapters of my life and why I am where I am today. 

Starting in high school and fueled by trying to find my place in the world, I developed an intense curiosity around existential questions. I began absorbing concepts related to identity, reincarnation, suffering, and the soul from various spiritual traditions and started questioning traditional assumptions about life, its purpose, and end goals. My bookcase still sports a copy of Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* from those days. 

In college and graduate school, I dove into ideas related to free will, causality, and moral responsibility through the lens of academic philosophy. 

I then embarked on a career as a mental health therapist where I was honored to witness concepts of personhood, social systems, and meaning through the lens of human psychological experience. 

**Now**, I am working with principles of object oriented programming, MVC design, and agile development as a junior software developer. While the concepts have become less abstract compared to free will or existential meaning, my passion to engage with ideas, solve puzzles, and pursue questions of *why* and *how* has not diminished. 

Now, **I use software to turn ideas into reality**.
