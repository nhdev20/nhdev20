### Hi there, my name is Nathan!

I am currently enrolled in Tech Elevator's full stack web development bootcamp. The stack we are learning is Java, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript (with Vue.js). Graduation is mid-August!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js - it is the final module of our bootcamp!

ðŸ”­ When I'm not working on homework or projects, Iâ€™m working on my Java console game called Fantasy Sword Duels - it is like Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with combat and magic and RPG elements (more details in the ReadMe in my repository)! There is also a project with a peer that utilizes social media API data, but more to come on that.
